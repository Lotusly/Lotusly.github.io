						<h2>A Sound from the Distance</h2>
						<hr class="star-primary">

						<p>
							There was a time when I was very addicted to playing Minecraft. I would play from morning to night without eating. Years later, I found that I was not the only one who became addicted to this game. Minecraft is the second popular digital game all over the world (the first is Tetris). And among friends of mine, no matter whom I talk Minecraft to, he would have experience to share. I thought over and over that what makes Minecraft so amazing. Then I saw its aesthetics, with which all the game elements work in perfect harmony and serve the central fantasy together. Minecraft is a masterpiece with charming grace. In this article, I will discuss how different elements in Minecraft support each other, and what kind of "central fantasy" they hold.
						</p>

						<p>
							Minecraft's mechanism has great freedom and fun embedded. As a sandbox game, Minecraft's central mechanism is to destroy and place blocks. The idea is just amazing, giving players unlimited ability of free building with only two simple rules. The very first Alpha version<a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.0" target="_blank">[1]</a> of Minecraft only has the two rules (and two basic blocks, soil and stone, with the multi-player function). It gained a lot of praises once posted. Players enjoyed the freedom, spending hours to build architectures like bridges, houses and sculptures, or just simply digging everywhere. The other mechanism is to use functional items like crafted tools or furnaces. It provides specialized functions in the game, which is necessary to make colorful experiences besides building. Vanilla Minecraft has enabled players to explore, to fight, to build, to destroy, to craft, to breed, to communicate with friends, etc. Players can freely choose their lifestyles in Minecraft with little pressure. The options are numerous, the punishment of death is little, and the goal of the game doesn't even exist. 
						</p>

						<p>
							However, no matter how many contents are included, it will never be infinity. After players get familiar with all the items and rules, (which may happen after hundreds of hours of playing though,) the game will finally be exploited fully. We can see the phenomenon in almost every game: open-world games, simulator games, sandboxes. But for Minecraft, this problem is resolved perfectly by Mods! Nowadays, Mods can add almost every imaginable function to Minecraft, and creating them is becoming easier and easier with developing tools<a href="https://mcreator.net/download" target="_blank">[2]</a>. It added infinite freedom to Minecraft where players are free to personalize the virtual world they live in and will never get bored.
						</p>


						<p>
							Art and sound in Minecraft further enhance its fantasy that has shown by its mechanism. It is natural to have the voxel art style, because it corresponds to the cubic blocks (like dirt and stone) in the game. Also, the simplicity of art achieves a high degree of abstraction of concepts. It helps players to focus on the virtual world and rules in it, instead of their realistic impressions. The music and sounds, on the other hand, are very amazing and smart. Before discussing it, we know that repeated background music in most games can easily cause auditory fatigue, and it more or less breaks the immersion (since background music is played by no physical device in the virtual world). But Minecraft avoids this problem by muting the background music. Players can only hear various sound effects (like sounds of animals and steps), which only add to the immersion of the experience.
						</p>

						<p>
							Muting background music is not often a good design. Music is actually super powerful in emotional expressions. It influences players' feelings all the time, and therefore sets the basis of the game atmosphere. But after all, it conveys not only "what the world is", but also "how the character feels about the world". This may be not obvious in logic, but we must remember that music is all about emotions, and in games, the emotions are from the main character (mostly). So once the background music is played, the emotions of the character are fixed, and the player needs to behave by these emotions to keep a good consistency. (As an example, this music<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeaZu3nSn9A" target="_blank">[3]</a> is clearly of happy and relaxing moods. If the character was fighting with this music playing, it feels weird and inconsistent.) It is great for RPG games, because RPG games' point is role-playing, where the players are expected to feel and behave as their pre-designed characters. Background music emphasizes the Characteristic and helps the players to understand the stories. But Minecraft doesn't want its players to play by the book. By muting the background music, Minecraft frees the players to feel and behave as themselves instead of the character. In Minecraft, characters are really the avatars of their players, the real humans.
						</p>

						<p>
							But Minecraft also plays background music in two situations. First, the player uses a CD on the CD machine. In this case the music has a reasonable physical source so it won't break the immersion. Second, very randomly the music can begin directly at any time, play once and then stop. How could this not break the immersion we discussed in last paraphrase? Well, I think it DOES. But Minecraft's sound designer is very smart to make this case a nice rest of the player's experience. The music is relaxing and quiet itself (which makes its fading in and out more natural and smooth). While the player is fully in his avatar, busy on whatever he does, this random music would make him back into his human body and rest for a little while. At the same time, I personally think this music stands for more of the world's physiologies rather than the character's emotions. It feels like the End Poem<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VWsq1JXVWY" target="_blank">[4]</a> of the survival mode, in which the avatar/player is discussed by two unknown wills (maybe gods). Minecraft makes such a psychological architecture that the player is fully free in a world of static rules, while the "will of the world" exists and observes the player. The emotions in the background music come from the "will of the world", and when it is played, the communication between the world and the player is established.
						</p>

						<p>
							After reading the background information<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nbe2h/i_am_the_composer_and_sound_designer_of_minecraft/" target="_blank">[5]</a> about the music designer of Minecraft, C418, I found that the music is casual creation inspired and driven by Minecraft’s very central core. Minecraft was just a funny prototype that allowed the player to destroy and place blocks when it inspired C418 to compose the original background music, Calm1-3. The casual, free and relaxing core of Minecraft, the graceful zen of concrete manifestation hinting infinite possibilities, are condensed into the music. It is why the music can represent the world's will. When the musical sound comes from the distance, the resonance is built up and the spirit is expressed by itself.
						</p>

						<p>
							In summary, Minecraft only defines the world itself but not how the player plays this game. The game is static there for the player to freely play with. It is where the freedom, the fantasy comes in Minecraft. Most games are like girls with elaborated make-up, all focusing on conveying things and leading the audience to their pre-designed directions; while Minecraft is like a girl with a clean face, standing with her nature and existence quietly. She can be your lover, your friend, or your mentor...... Only when she doesn't attempt to narrow your views or lead the relationship between you and her, that you can ever reach out to find the relationship you want; you can understand her existence and care about her after all. I believe it is why that so many people love Minecraft: they are themselves in the virtual world.

						<!--h2>遥远的声音</h2>
						<hr class="star-primary">

						<p>
							*注：此篇博客仅代表个人经历，个人观点和感受抒发，建议不要浪费时间归纳主旨。
						</p>

						<p>
							曾经有一段时间我非常沉迷于玩Minecraft，会不吃不喝地从早玩到晚上。直至今日，当有人问起我对“神作”的定义时，我会这样说：“神作就是在所有的游戏元素上都优秀，而又有那么几点出类拔萃登峰造极。”然后我会想起Minecraft，再补充上一句：“而且所有的游戏元素都切合其核心的精神意志，使整体和谐，浑然天成。”因为我认为Minecraft，这个小神作，就是一件浑然天成的艺术品。
						</p>

						<p>
							Minecraft的游戏自由度高得不可思议。并且这种高自由度并不是通过繁复的设计来实现的，反而是因为设计者充分给予玩家自己做决定的权利而实现的。Minecraft中对玩家行为的引导极其少，就连tutorial都只有破坏、放置和建造工作台这样基本的项目，成就系统（1.11版前）作为一条可行的游戏主线指引，对玩家也不作奖励或惩罚，而更像是攻略系统。作为一款沙盒游戏，它用心地将开发者隐藏在了“模拟世界”的背后，而将玩家放在了“生活”的中心。这就是Minecraft的核心精神，也是它吸引众多玩家的核心原因之一。（Minecraft是电子游戏史上除了俄罗斯方块之外玩家最多的游戏。）无数的玩家在Minecraft中选择了自己的生活方式：建造自己喜欢的住所，收集物品，进行冒险，观赏风景，豢养宠物，发展工农业，设计红石电路和音乐。

						</p>

						<p>
							这样的自由思想在Minecraft的众多游戏元素中都得到了体现。它将世界中所有物体都简化为立体方块模型，再给予玩家破坏和放置方块的主游戏机制，使玩家通过排列组合方块就可以自由构建世界。它的立体像素风艺术风格，不但和世界模型完美一致，并且其抽象简化的表达力更使玩家专注于建造物的结构，各方块的职能等本征，而非视觉细节。它的高随机性地图生成、生物生成，也是用极简规则制造高度独特的个性化体验。它的红石系统更是赋予了玩家自由制造电子设备的超能力。Minecraft的方方面面协作着为玩家创造了高度自由的游戏精神和体验。其中，Minecraft的背景音乐尤其令我印象深刻。

						</p>

						<p>
							凡是做过游戏背景音乐设计的人都应知道诸多大忌，在此我想谈谈其反复刺激听觉导致玩家疲劳，以及脱离游戏世界破坏沉浸感这两点。我大约能连续听音乐四个小时，耐性算是正常的，而我身边的一些人只有一个小时左右的耐性。（当然确实也有不少可以连续听十几小时的高人。）每次当我连续玩一个游戏达到三四小时时，都不得不把背景音乐关掉，只保留音效提供反馈。而在沉浸感方面，背景音乐因为通常不属于世界设定中正常的声音，多少会将玩家剥离出游戏人物，让玩家产生“这是一个游戏”而非“这是一个我真正生活在的世界”的感觉。尤其是一些设计得过于激进和有个性的背景音乐，无时无刻不给玩家以虚拟感受和强听觉刺激。Minecraft则没有这两个问题。在Minecraft中，大部分时候是没有背景音乐的。一片平静之中玩家只听到高低远近错落的动物鸣叫，和自己的脚步声等音效，这就让这个世界显得格外的真实，也能让玩家连续游玩而轻松不疲劳，还能让玩家专注于游戏内容本身。但是呢，它其实也是有背景音乐的。节奏舒缓、音符零散的背景音乐会偶尔响起，自然地淡入，播放一会儿后又自然地淡出，丝毫不干扰玩家，成为游戏的一大舒适体验。
						</p>

						<p>
							游戏中的唱片收集明显是遵循自由精神的一种设计。此外更让我觉得有趣的一点是，Minecraft的音乐气氛和结局（打败末影龙）之后的《终末之诗》的视角谜之契合。《终末之诗》的视角是几个更高维度空间的存在观察着Steve（游戏主角），议论着，欣赏着，关心着他的感受和体验。而Minecraft在一片安寂中小心淡入的背景音乐，也小心地让玩家获得短暂的更高维度视角。如我在上段中所说，背景音乐有破坏沉浸感的作用，这并不必然是一件坏事。本来沉浸在Steve角色扮演中的游戏玩家，被背景音乐所提醒，而更换了视角去看待这个世界和主角的故事，正像《终末之诗》中所讲的一样，欣赏、议论——关心着那个世界和主角的故事。这种脱离沉浸感，因为音乐中所表达的内容是那样的合乎这个世界，合乎玩家的感受，使得玩家反而更加关心这个拥有了一抹个性的世界和角色。Minecraft的音乐所表达的内容无疑是非常适合这款游戏的。
						</p>

						<p>
							长期以来，我一直以为Minecraft的音乐音效是精心设计成就的大象无形。但阅读了Minecraft音乐设计师C418的答玩家问和背景资料后，我发现，这音乐是随性创作的结果。C418进行创作时Minecraft仅仅是一个极简的prototype，只是一个能让玩家破坏，拾取和放置方块的滑稽模型。C418对这个滑稽模型的感受凝聚成了最初的Minecraft原声背景音乐，Calm1-3，也即后来应用的Minecraft主背景音乐之一。那音乐中的随性、洒脱、宁静、灵动，正是C418对Minecraft核心机制、游戏精神的直观感受的具象体现。那音乐为游戏的内核所启发，又转而为游戏的内核增色添彩，激发起玩家的情感共鸣。当玩家耳边响起那遥远的声音，在天地间回荡的是自由的气氛，是在遥远异世界自我放逐、自我追求的无数灵魂的共鸣，是一种精神在表达它自身。
						</p>

						<p>
							说起Minecraft中这种遥远的音乐，我就想起《上古卷轴5：天际》。这大概是我累积游戏时长最长的一部游戏，其中许多设计令我深深折服。作为一款开放世界沙盒游戏，它的音乐竟也与Minecraft有着异曲同工之妙。许多时候并无背景音乐，而往往当我在天际省的无垠旷野之上奔跑的时候，遥远的天空轻轻回荡起那首宁静悠扬的Far Horizon，真乃画龙点睛之笔。
